# qPCR analyzer

## Process your output files from Thermo Fisher's QuantStudio

This R script takes a directory containing one or multiple Excel files (both XLS and XLSX supported) generated by QuantStudio and outputs average CTs, delta CTs and levels (2^-(delta ct)).

### Required arguments

- The path to the input directory where the QuantStudio Excel files are located. Do not place any other files in this directory.
- The name of the housekeeping gene that will be used to calculate delta CTs and levels (case sensitive).

### Output
An Excel file with the same name as the input directory and the following tabs will be created:
- CTs
- Average CTs (per gene and sample)
- Delta CTs
- Levels

In addition, warnings will be raised for samples with technical replicates with a standard deviation > 0.5

### Example command
Run the _Rscript_ command in your terminal followed by the R script file path and the two arguments separated by spaces:
```
Rscript qPCR_analyzer.R quantstudio_files/ ACTIN
```
